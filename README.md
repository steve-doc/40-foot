* ### Bugs found a fixed
    1. On deployment discovered images failed to load.  
        Solved by changing image address to relative rather than absolute.
    2. Title under Apres Swim images was overlapping images.
        Solved by adding a container around images and adding padding bottom to image and container.
    3. Container border around circular image became eliptical at certain points when screen was narrowed for smaller devices.
        Solved by using media queries to give images and container defined, small width and height at smaller screen sizes.
