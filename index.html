        <h2>A Healthy Habit</h2>

        <div>
            <h3>Feel Strong</h3>
            <p>Young and old, athlete or not, the 40 Foot is a great place to take your daily exercise.  Swimming is a low impact exercise, easy on the joints. Exercise aside, jumping in for even a couple of minutes provides a number of physical benefits.  Exposure the cold water can increase metabolism and reduce inflamation and muscle pain</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Clear the Head</h3>
            <p>There is something almost indescribable about plunging into the salty cold water.  A release of dopamine or a surge of adrenalin, it does seem to matter what mood you are in when you arrive, you will leave with a smile on your face.  Higher energy levels and energised to launch into the day are just some of the claims of the regular dippers.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>A Sense of Community</h3>
            <p>This little haven is the ideal place to connect with friends that otherwise we struggle to find time to meet. Get some quality family time sharing the euphoria of a weekend dip and a hot chocolate afterwards.  Drop down for a dip with the team after the match.  Even if you turn up on your own it won't be long before you connect with the other regulars through this shared experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Connect with Nature</h3>
            <p>The smell of the sea and the noise of the waves is part what sets a dip in the 40 Foot apart from the local swimming pool. There is also the thrill of spotting one of the local seals. The seals tend to keep to themselves but they are always nearby, sometime basking on a rock or passing by to do fish for their breakfast.  It feels like such a privalage to be sharing this beautful spot with them.</p>
